# Weather_Forecasting_ML_project
A machine learning-based weather prediction system leverages meteorological data and advanced models like K-Nearest Neighbor, Random forest, Logistic Regression to capture temporal patterns. Optimized using error metrics such as MAE and RMSE, it provides real-time, accurate forecasts to support agriculture, disaster management, and other sectors.
